### AI LAB - Housing Price Prediction Project

#### Author: (EJ) Vivek Pandey

The Housing Price Prediction Project aims to generate housing appraisals to determine values of properties in the United States. 

This repository contains all the associated work that has been done for the area which includes:
* Web Crawler to gather housing data
* Notebooks associated with data engineering, EDA, and ML Modeling
* Serverless API setup to make predictions off the serialized models
* Web App

### Future Enhancements
* Adding support to crawl and extract through remaining 3 property page formats in Trulia
* Spiders in Web Crawler to extract data from Zillow
* Speeding up the crawler with distributed spiders
* Feeding the ML model with data of properties across the US and making necessary adjustments based on new results, instead of the tri-states properties it is limited to (but this requires the above three enhancements to be done first)
