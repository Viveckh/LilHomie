### LilHomie - Housing Price Prediction Rapid Prototype

### Author: [(EJ) Vivek Pandey](https://viveckh.com)

LilHomie is a rapid prototyping project that aims to generate housing appraisals to determine values of properties in the New York Tri-state Area. 

This repository contains all the associated work that has been done for the area which includes:
* Web Crawler to gather housing data
* Notebooks associated with data engineering, EDA, and ML Modeling
* Serverless API setup to make predictions off the serialized models
* Web App

### Future Enhancements
* Adding support to crawl and extract through remaining 3 property page formats in Trulia
* Spiders in Web Crawler to extract data from Zillow
* Speeding up the crawler with distributed spiders
* Feeding the ML model with data of properties across the US and making necessary adjustments based on new results, instead of the tri-states properties it is limited to (but this requires the above three enhancements to be done first)
